# The purpose of this project is to use pandas and jupyter to analyze school spending, students test scores to improve students performance.


There are 39,170 students attending 15 high schools, 7 district and 8 charter.  
The total budget is $24,649,428.00.  
The overall passing percent is 65.17%.  
The average math score is 78.98 and the average reading score is 81.87.  
The percentage passing math is 74.98% and the percentage passing reading is 85.80%.

Now we’re looking closely at each school and their performance and spendings.
The top five performance school are charter.  The least five performance school are district.  
Charter school tend to have less student population compared to district, therefore spend less money per student.  
In addition, school ranked first on the list Cabrera high school spend $582 per student, and last on the list Johnson High School spend $650 per student.

The trend I’ve noticed is that spending per student does not increase performance.  
When school spend less than $585 have the best result compared to spending range $645-680.

I also check performance based on school sizes.

Another trend I’ve noticed is scores by size.  
School that performed at the top level 90.62% overall passing have between 1000-2000 students.  
Larger school with population ranging between 2000-5000 have the worst performance 58.28% in overall passing. 
School size <1000 have overall passing rate of 89%.

When compared school type I’ve noticed charter schools performed better than district in term of percent passing reading, math, and overall passing. 
District schools struggle with percent passing math they only have 66.54% passing math and 53.67% overall passing. 

Academically, charter schools outperformed district schools in percent passing of both reading and math. 
District schools scored below 70% in passing math.  Both Math and Reading scores by grade level stay consistence from 9th to 12th, there is no variation between grade level.

In conclusion, school size should be between 1000-2000 students at high school level. 
Spending per students should be around $585 - $630.  However, spending per students does not increase performance.  
Charter schools outperformed district schools since their size are relatively smaller compared to district.  
Given the information from the data we should focus on school size and teacher per student ratios to help schools increase their academic performance.  
Spending more money on students does not guarantee academic performance.
